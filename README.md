**Blumen** is a CLI and API library to deploy apps on the decentralized web using IPFS and Ethereum.

> Blumen is in an alpha stage and has been neither audited nor tested yet. Use with caution!

## Features

- **Multi-Provider Deployment**: Deploy your web app simultaneously on multiple IPFS providers, including [web3.storage](https://web3.storage) and [Gateway3](https://gateway3.io), ensuring redundancy and availability.
- **ENS Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with [ENS](https://ens.domains) to update your Content-Hash, making it easier for users to access your web app via ENS gateways.
- **Safe Integration**: Update your ENS Content-Hash using a multisig [Safe](https://safe.global) contract, adding an extra layer of security and decentralization.
